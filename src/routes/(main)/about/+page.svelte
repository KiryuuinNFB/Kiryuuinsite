                    Hi I'm Kiryuuin. You might know me from my youtube channel Kiryuuin / NFB Production. I do remixes of songs from video games, anime and movies that I like. 
                    Turned into genres you and me can enjoy. I also have an interest in programming, 3D modelling and animation too. I just didn't post them on my channel as much as music.

                </p>
                <p class="pt-8">
                    Other than that. I just do stuff in my free time. Like playing video games, building Gunplas, balisong flipping or just talking to people on discord.
                </p>
