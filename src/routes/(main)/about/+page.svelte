					This is the more detailed page about me so I'll tell you everything. I'm Kiryuuin and I've
					been making music and posting them on my youtube channel, Kiryuuin / NFB Production for
					over 6 years now. I first started on remixing Touhou songs. Then eventually started doing
					songs from other fandoms as well. I will try to make everything that I like. I've made
					remixes in several genres because of this.
				</p>
				<p class="pt-4">
					I also have an interest in other fields as well. Like programming where I've made a web
					application for my school to use during the science day. and 3D renders where my friends
					use them in their project. I'm looking forward to improve and be as good as the
					professionals in these fields.

					This site is where I keep my instrumentals so you don't have to join my discord server
					just to download them. And if you want to commission me, The details are on this site over
					on the commission page as well. This site is also for me to put what I have learned about web dev to use.
